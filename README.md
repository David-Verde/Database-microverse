## Getting Started
![Sin t√≠tulo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99683363/184953672-29361040-f650-4ff6-bdaf-2ea5fbc01de1.png)

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
